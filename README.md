# Repository for Mini Projects conducted at the «Statistics, R and data analysis» study course by Blastim in 2022

> This repository for **mini-projects** in Statistics and R

The idea behind this repository is to:
1. Demonstrate my skills in statistics and R
2. If I made some mistakes, you can contact me via [email](mailto:iljapopov17@gmail.com) and say bad-words about my skills
3. Share the data so you can do analysis by yourself

Data is uploading gradually... Please wait. Every project will be uploaded!

## Project 4. Metabolites of primates

Metabolite concentrations measured in human, chimpanzee and macaque brain, kidney and muscle. Each sample is known by sex, age and whether it differs by technology.

## Project 3. Controlled evolutionary inheritance

In the laboratory, they do an experiment with Drosophila in which they force the X chromosome to be inherited only in the female line in many generations. _To prevent the expression of X in males, a balancing chromosome called FM is used - this is a modified X with overlapping inversions that does not recombine with normal X._

## Project 2. Marker for pneumonia

A low ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T-lymphocytes (CD4/CD8) in peripheral blood may be associated with chronic inflammation in HIV and may be a marker of chronic lung disease in this population. A dataset of 190 subjects is used to test the possible relationship.

## Project 1. Ant microbiomes

The [project](Ant%20microbiomes) studies the regulation of microbial communities in the gut of _Camponotus floridanus_ ants. It is hypothesised that these ants control their microbiota and food-borne pathogens by ingesting a toxic secretion produced by their own glands. The main component of the secretion is formic acid.
