# Repository for Mini Projects conducted at the ¬´Statistics, R and data analysis¬ª study course by Blastim in 2022

> This repository for **projects** in Statistics and R

The idea behind this repository is to:
1. Demonstrate my skills in statistics and R
2. If I made some mistakes, you can contact me via [email](mailto:iljapopov17@gmail.com) and say bad-words about my skills<br>(I did these projects 2 years ago, I just decided to publish them now, so there ARE little mistakes)
4. Share the data so you can do analysis by yourself

Data is uploading gradually... Please wait. Every project will be uploaded! (I hope so)

## Project 4. Metabolites of primates üêí

Metabolite concentrations measured in human, chimpanzee and macaque brain, kidney and muscle. Each sample is known by sex, age and whether it differs by technology.

## Project 3. Controlled evolutionary inheritance üß¨

In the laboratory, they do an experiment with Drosophila in which they force the X chromosome to be inherited only in the female line in many generations. _To prevent the expression of X in males, a balancing chromosome called FM is used - this is a modified X with overlapping inversions that does not recombine with normal X._

## Project 2. Marker for pneumonia üí®

A low ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T-lymphocytes (CD4/CD8) in peripheral blood may be associated with chronic inflammation in HIV and may be a marker of chronic lung disease in this population. A dataset of 190 subjects is used to test the possible relationship.

## Project 1. Ant microbiomes üêú

The [project](Ant%20microbiomes) studies the regulation of microbial communities in the gut of _Camponotus floridanus_ ants. It is hypothesised that these ants control their microbiota and food-borne pathogens by ingesting a toxic secretion produced by their own glands. The main component of the secretion is formic acid.
